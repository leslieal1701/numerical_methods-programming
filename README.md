# numerical_methods-programming
Python scripts that demonstrate the application of appropriate numerical methods to solve engineering problems


- Assignment 4: Goal- Develop a module to perform a least squares polynomial fit of data. Then apply that module to 
fit launch data from a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch.
- Assignment 5: Goal- Polish bisection method function and apply it to a practical root‚Äêfinding problem involving the the compressibility factor for methane.
- Assignment 6: Goal- Use SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch data and piecewise polynomial fits of the velocity data to approximate the acceleration of the rocket.
- Asingment 7: Goal- Integrate SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket velocity data to compute the total distance travelled by the rocket in achieving orbit.
- Assignment 8: Goal- Optimize the process of commuting to work by employing statistics
- Assignment 9: Goal - Implement explicit time-marching schemes within an object-oriented framework to solve a system of ODEs and model the dynamics of a crane cable that might fail when the crane mechanism seizes up while lowering a load.
